### Can I share the logs for the operator application ?

For each app, you can hit the menu item and open `Help` => `Show internal diagnostics`

You can then copy the whole log file with `Ctrl+A` and `Ctrl+C` 

If you can [paste this](https://gist.github.com/) and share it
in the github issue, that will help us a lot.
